This is the sixth and final project for my Game Technology Course. For this project I made a very simple 3D shooting RPG.
In this game, the goal is to save Metal Town by shooting all of the targets then defeating the final target boss to lift the curse of reflectiveness.

## Implementation

The 3D stove asset was from the furniture kit on Kenny (https://www.kenney.nl/assets/furniture-kit).
